# Cultivating Authentic Fashion Journalism

A culture thrives when it's accompanied by genuine storytelling. While the Western world has long embraced fashion journalism for dissecting style, critiquing trends, celebrating craftsmanship, and weaving narratives, India's approach to this art form still remains fixated on celebrity endorsements and brand promotions.

## Embracing the Guide-Driven Approach

The Western culture has ingrained a guide-driven approach that extends beyond just fashion. Whether it's selecting the perfect restaurant for an intimate dinner or immersing oneself in the pages of fashion magazines for style inspiration, the West's guide-driven ethos has left an indelible mark. Just as the Michelin Guide established a benchmark for exquisite dining experiences in France, fashion magazines like GQ and Esquire originally emerged as trendsetters, offering insightful advice on men's fashion and lifestyle choices. The emergence of independent online blogging and journalism has further enriched this landscape, with passionate individuals prioritizing quality and authenticity over pandering to brand interests.

## Breaking the Cycle in India

In contrast, India's fashion journalism seems entrapped in a cycle of imitation. The Indian editions of GQ, Vogue, and similar publications, much like their Western counterparts today, heavily rely on celebrity trends and luxury branding, perpetuating a narrative that remains distant from the everyday consumer.

## Celebrating Artisans and Authenticity

Artisans, characterized by their unwavering commitment to quality and distinctive designs, often struggle to find a platform to showcase their craftsmanship. In Bangalore, where I reside, there is a skilled horologist around the corner who has been meticulously repairing and servicing watches for numerous years. Additionally, emerging clothing brands like Monks of Method prioritize exceptional quality, top-notch customer service, and impeccably crafted garments. The ascent of online platforms and social media provides a voice for these artisans, fostering a community that reveres authenticity.

## Unveiling Opportunities in India's Fashion Landscape

The scarcity of a suit culture within India's fashion landscape presents a unique challenge. While discussing the nuances of a finely tailored suit is relatively straightforward, conversations about everyday attire like shirts and trousers are frequently overlooked. However, this oversight can be seen as an opportunity in disguise. It encourages a deeper exploration of fabrics, stitching techniques, and overall quality of these everyday essentials, ultimately nurturing a more enlightened consumer base. The internet has exposed us to a realm of boundless possibilities, enabling seamless access to quality products from any corner of the world and offering access to top-tier online journalism from anywhere. As a result, our style horizons can expand, aiding in identifying cultural gaps and devising ways to bridge them.

## Fostering a Culture through Dialogue

Let us remember that it's through discourse and exploration that we can genuinely shape a culture that resonates with the soul of the nation. As eloquently expressed by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, "Culture does not make people. People make culture."
