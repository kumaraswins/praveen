I came across an article on American Western wear that suggested the origins of American democracy can be traced back to a Germanic Forest, like continental seeds blowing in the wind and eventually growing in North America. Suppose if someone lacks exposure to various fields or suppose if someone who isn’t gifted with the power of language, expressing an idea like the above becomes a challenge.

In the 1960s, American movie critics like Bosley Crowther played a pivotal role in the rise of review culture. It started with European movies coming into the USA and the critics were looking for something more than the story and other obvious stuffs to talk about.

Bosley Crowther, a New York Times journalist, wrote reviews that were scholarly rather than breezy. His career took a hit due to his scathing review of "Bonnie and Clyde". He was aware of his review's impact and intentionally conveyed his displeasure. Mr. Crowther’s review read thus:

> “It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cutups in Thoroughly Modern Millie”

It’s as if he is at a loss for what to say about the movie, turned to the power of language to make the review look interesting.

An alternate review by Pauline Kael used everyday words to praise the film's excitement and connection with the audience, showcasing the power of simplicity.

> “Bonnie and Clyde’ is the most excitingly American movie since ‘The Manchurian Candidate’  The audience is alive to it. Our experience as we watch it has some connection with the way we reacted to movies in childhood: with how we came to love them and to feel they were ours—not an art that we learned over the years to appreciate but simply and immediately ours”

What would fashion journalism be without adjectives, bombastic words, and not something that talks about the technicality of fabric or even about why some styles work and others don't. Fashion photographer Scott Schumans’ wonderful portrait is the answer.
